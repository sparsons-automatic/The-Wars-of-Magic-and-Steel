# The Wars of Magic and Steel

*A childrenâ€™s fantasy novel-in-progress (ages 8â€“9)*

This repository contains the chapters of **The Wars of Magic and Steel**, a story about Brannoc, a young mouse who discovers a gift for elemental magic in a kingdom at war with the rats. Along the way, he meets unlikely mentors, faces sword trials, and learns that courage is more than steelâ€”itâ€™s the heart to choose a different path.

## âœ¨ Vision
This project is meant to be read by kids (8â€“9 years old) and parents together as a bedtime story or early-reader adventure. Tone is kept PG, with real stakes but no heavy violence.
