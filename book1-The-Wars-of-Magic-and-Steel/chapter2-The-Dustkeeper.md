## Chapter Two: The Dustkeeper

The training ring was silent. Mice stared at Brannoc as if he’d grown wings instead of whiskers. His heart pounded in his chest, paws tingling with the memory of the forces that had surged from him. Korrin still sat in the sand, blinking in shock.

“He… he shoved me,” Korrin muttered, though no paw had touched him.

Sir Alder’s voice rumbled low, breaking the whispers. “Enough. The match is over.”

Alder’s earlier question still rang in Bran’s ears.

Alder raised a paw for quiet, projecting his voice across the ring. “Overextension and a shield shove,” he said, crisp and certain. “Textbook counter when your opponent outruns his lunge. Happens every trial.” He pointed to the scuffed edge of Bran’s practice shield and the furrow in the sand where Korrin’s feet had slid. “You charge crooked, you get knocked crooked. Learn from it.”

A murmur rolled around the ring—some skeptical, some relieved. A few trainees nodded as if they’d seen it that way all along; others traded looks that said they hadn’t seen any shove at all.

“Back to the barracks,” Sir Alder barked. “Drills resume after midday. No shows. No gossip.” The line of mice loosened and scattered.

Somewhere behind him, Korrin hissed to a friend, “Rematch. With real steel someday.”

Bran stooped to pick up his practice sword, but his paws shook so badly he dropped it again. Heat crept up his ears. The laughter was gone now—replaced with wary glances, tails flicking as if every other mouse wanted to step back.

As the last of the trainees filed out, Alder bent down, close enough that only Bran could hear. “There are powers older than steel, boy. Powers most would rather forget.” His whiskers twitched. “If you’d understand what stirs in you, seek the Dustkeeper.”

Bran blinked. “The… Dustkeeper?”

“You’ll find him in the outer tunnels, beyond the lantern-moss. Few dare visit.” Alder’s eyes narrowed. “Tell no one. Do you hear? Not even your kin. The less the council knows, the safer you’ll be.” He dipped his head, barely a whisper: “Try the bell-change, third hour.” He straightened, loud again for any stragglers listening: “Keep your chatter to footwork and shield angles. Leave the rest to your instructors.”

Bran nodded, throat dry.

That evening, Bran sat at the family table, pushing peas across his plate. His mother noticed at once. “What happened at the trials?” she asked, voice sharp but worried. “I heard whispers all through the market—something about a shove?”

They’d marched past the market stalls at midday; tongues had wagged before the soup even boiled.

Bran’s ears drooped. He clung to Alder’s angle. “Korrin overran his lunge,” he said, eyes on his plate. “I caught him on the rim of my shield. Sir Alder called it and sent us off.”

His mother’s jaw unclenched a fraction. “From a tiny shield tap?” she murmured, skeptical. She brushed her paw across Bran’s ear. “Not every mouse is meant for battle, Bran. You’ll find your place.”

Bran nodded, though his chest ached. He excused himself early, retreating to his small straw bed. Sleep wouldn’t come. Whispers of the other trainees haunted him, and Sir Alder’s words echoed louder than dreams: *Seek the Dustkeeper.*

As he lay staring at the rafters, Bran thought of the way Korrin had flown backwards, the startled looks of the others. Rumors were already seeping through the tunnels. By morning, the whole kingdom would know, and the council would demand answers. He knew he had little time before whispers turned into judgment.

When the household finally grew still, Bran eased from his bed. He crept past his siblings’ soft snores, past his mother’s chair where her knitting lay unfinished, and slipped into the tunnels with only his satchel and courage.

---

The air cooled as he left the main passages. Lantern-moss gave way to bare roots and shadows. Two tight turns of the spiral stair and the long root that marked halfway slipped under his paw; the change of watch left the market corridor empty for a few breaths, and he slid through that hush. The kingdom’s chatter faded behind him, replaced by the slow drip of unseen water.

Strange bundles hung from the ceiling roots—feathers bound with twine, little pouches of stones, shapes carved from bone. Bran’s whiskers quivered. His mother would’ve cuffed his ears if she knew where he was creeping.

At last, he saw a glow ahead: not lantern-moss, but candlelight. A figure hunched over a desk carved from stone roots, pages scattered around like fallen leaves.

The figure was tall and slender, fur patchy with age. A weasel.

Bran froze. Every story he’d heard said weasels were sly, dangerous, never to be trusted.

Without looking up, the weasel spoke. His voice was soft, warm as an old blanket. “You made quite a stir in the ring today, young mouse.”

Bran’s breath caught. “You… you know?”

The weasel finally raised his head, cloudy eyes glinting in the candlelight. “Such forces do not rise for just anyone. Come closer, Brannoc. My name is Thistledown—most whisper “Dustkeeper.” You may call me teacher, if you’re brave enough.

Even the council had once sought Thistledown for old matters—before they pretended to forget.”

Bran hesitated at the doorway. His paws itched to turn back, yet something deeper urged him forward.

The Dustkeeper gestured to a shelf stacked with tomes bound in faded leather. “The council fears what it does not understand. But you… you’ve been chosen by the old magic. And old magic always demands to be learned.”

Bran stepped into the room, dust swirling around his paws. His heart thudded with both fear and wonder.

The Dustkeeper cleared a space on the desk, brushing away a drift of dust. From a small drawer, he drew out a single scrap of parchment and placed it before Bran. “If you wish to learn, begin not with strength, but with focus. Return and learn to move this—not with paw or breath, but with thought alone.”

Bran blinked at the paper. “Move it? Without touching?”

The Dustkeeper’s whiskers twitched in amusement. “The sword teaches strength of arm. Magic teaches strength of mind. If you can stir even this, those forces will answer you again.”

Bran’s paws prickled. He nodded, though his voice failed him.

“Go now,” said the Dustkeeper, turning back to his candlelight and tomes. “Sleep on the thought. Let it follow you into your dreams.”

Bran slipped back into the tunnels, heart racing. Three bends past the cracked lintel, he found the familiar thread of lantern-moss that led him home. Behind him, the candlelight flickered, and dust lifted gently into the air, swirling like it was waiting for him to return.

---

Bran hurried home through the dim passages, the soft glow of lantern-moss guiding his way. The tunnels were quieter now, their usual chatter replaced by the steady heartbeat of dripping water. He paused near his family’s doorway, ears twitching for any sound inside. Only the faint rustle of straw and his mother’s slow breathing answered.

He slipped through the curtain, careful not to disturb the floorboards. His satchel brushed against the doorframe, and he froze—but no one stirred. Relief fluttered through him as he crept to his bed, sliding under the rough blanket and pulling it up to his chin.

Sleep did not come easily. Each time he closed his eyes, he saw the parchment lying on the Dustkeeper’s desk, the faint shimmer of dust swirling in candlelight. His whiskers tingled, and he imagined the paper lifting, turning, changing shape at his command.

Then his dreams turned strange. Water rippled beneath his paws—cool, endless, shimmering like glass. He reached out, and the surface obeyed, rising and curling around his fingers. It formed shapes: a wave, a spiral, then a mouse of pure water that danced before falling apart.

Bran woke with a start. The cavern was still. Only the faint drip of a leaky pipe echoed nearby, like the rhythm of his heartbeat. He pressed a paw to his chest and whispered to the dark, “I didn’t just dream that… did I?”

The water dripped once more, steady as breathing. Bran stared until his eyes grew heavy again, the image of that dancing water-mouse fading slowly into sleep.

---

Morning came with the faint light of lantern-moss seeping through the cracks in the tunnel walls. Bran stirred beneath his blanket, his dreams clinging like cobwebs. The image of water coiling around his paws refused to leave him.

His mother was already bustling near the hearth, stirring a pot of grain. His siblings chattered sleepily as they dressed, oblivious to the secret burning behind Bran’s tired eyes.

He tried to eat, but each spoonful felt distant. Every sound—the clink of a cup, the sigh of wind through the roots—made him think of the Dustkeeper’s voice and that scrap of parchment waiting in the candlelight.

At the market, he helped his mother stack pouches of grain, but his paws moved on their own. His thoughts kept drifting: *What if I could move it again? What if I could move something bigger?* He shook himself, dropping a pouch and earning a gentle scold.

All through the morning, Bran felt the same restless hum in his whiskers, a silent echo of his dream. Whatever was stirring in him, it refused to be quiet. Word was the council scribes were tangled in levy-rolls this week; gossip would have to queue.

---

By midday, his mother sent him to fetch water from a nearby stream. The path wound between roots and low ferns, sunlight trickling down through cracks far above. He settled on a smooth stone and unwrapped his lunch: a heel of bread and a slice of carrot. The stream gurgled softly beside him, clear and cool. Bran watched the way the water curled around the rocks and imagined it lifting, shaping itself the way it had in his dream. His whiskers twitched. For a moment, he thought he saw a ripple form the faint outline of a paw before it vanished downstream.

He sat there longer than he should have, lost in thought, until the sound of a far-off bell reminded him to return home. Evening chores waited.

Back at the burrow, the scent of stew filled the air. Bran scrubbed his paws clean, helped his siblings gather kindling, and set the table as his mother ladled dinner. His father returned from the harvest tunnels, weary but cheerful, teasing Bran about growing taller before winter.

They ate together by the dim glow of the hearth. Conversation drifted from market gossip to harvest quotas and back again. Bran nodded and smiled when spoken to, but his mind was elsewhere—on the parchment, on the Dustkeeper, on the strange feeling in his chest that refused to fade.

When supper was done and the younger mice were ushered to bed, Bran pretended to yawn and followed. The warmth of the stew settled in his stomach, but sleep remained distant. He stared at the ceiling, listening to the burrow grow still.

At last, when the snores around him deepened, Bran slipped from his blankets. His heart thudded as he glanced toward the tunnel mouth leading out into the dark. Tomorrow, he would return to the Dustkeeper.

And this time, he would be ready.
