## Chapter Two: The Dustkeeper

The training ring was silent. Mice stared at Brannoc as if he’d grown wings instead of whiskers. His heart pounded in his chest, paws tingling where the gust of wind had burst forth. Korrin still sat in the sand, blinking in shock.

“He… he shoved me,” Korrin muttered, though no paw had touched him.

Sir Alder’s voice rumbled low, breaking the whispers. “Enough. The match is over.”

Bran stooped to pick up his practice sword, but his paws shook so badly he dropped it again. Heat crept up his ears. The laughter was gone now—replaced with wary glances, tails flicking as if every other mouse wanted to step back.

“Back to the barracks,” Sir Alder barked. The trainees scattered, muttering to one another. By morning, every corner of the kingdom would be buzzing with talk of Brannoc’s strange outburst.

Bran lingered, staring at the sand where his sword lay. Alder bent down, close enough that only Bran could hear. “There are powers older than steel, boy. Powers most would rather forget.” His whiskers twitched. “If you’d understand what stirs in you, seek the Dustkeeper.”

Bran blinked. “The… Dustkeeper?”

“You’ll find him in the outer tunnels, beyond the lantern-moss. Few dare visit.” Alder’s eyes narrowed. “Tell no one. Do you hear? Not even your kin. The less the council knows, the safer you’ll be.”

Bran nodded, throat dry.

That evening, Bran sat at the family table, pushing peas across his plate. His mother noticed at once. “What happened at the trials?” she asked, voice sharp but worried. “I heard whispers all through the market—something about a wind?”

Bran’s ears drooped. He tried to find words, but his throat locked. He could only shrug and mumble, “I dropped my sword.”

His mother sighed, brushing her paw across his ear. “Not every mouse is meant for battle, Bran. You’ll find your place.”

Bran nodded, though his chest ached. He excused himself early, retreating to his small straw bed. Sleep wouldn’t come. Whispers of the other trainees haunted him, and Sir Alder’s words echoed louder than dreams: *Seek the Dustkeeper.*

As he lay staring at the rafters, Bran thought of the way Korrin had flown backwards, the startled looks of the others. Rumors were already seeping through the tunnels. By morning, the whole kingdom would know, and the council would demand answers. He knew he had little time before whispers turned into judgment.

When the household finally grew still, Bran eased from his bed. He crept past his siblings’ soft snores, past his mother’s chair where her knitting lay unfinished, and slipped into the tunnels with only his satchel and courage.

The air cooled as he left the main passages. Lantern-moss gave way to bare roots and shadows. The kingdom’s chatter faded behind him, replaced by the slow drip of unseen water.

Strange bundles hung from the ceiling roots—feathers bound with twine, little pouches of stones, shapes carved from bone. Bran’s whiskers quivered. His mother would’ve cuffed his ears if she knew where he was creeping.

At last, he saw a glow ahead: not lantern-moss, but candlelight. A figure hunched over a desk carved from stone roots, pages scattered around like fallen leaves.

The figure was tall and slender, fur patchy with age. A weasel.

Bran froze. Every story he’d heard said weasels were sly, dangerous, never to be trusted.

Without looking up, the weasel spoke. His voice was soft, warm as an old blanket. “You made quite a gust in the ring today, young mouse.”

Bran’s breath caught. “You… you know?”

The weasel finally raised his head, cloudy eyes glinting in the candlelight. “The wind does not rise for just anyone. Come closer, Brannoc. They call me Thistledown. Some whisper ‘Dustkeeper.’ But you may call me teacher, if you’re brave enough.”

Bran hesitated at the doorway. His paws itched to turn back, yet something deeper urged him forward.

Thistledown gestured to a shelf stacked with tomes bound in faded leather. “The council fears what it does not understand. But you… you’ve been chosen by the old magic. And old magic always demands to be learned.”

Bran stepped into the room, dust swirling around his paws. His heart thudded with both fear and wonder.

Thistledown reached into a drawer and placed three small objects on the desk: a feather, a stone, and a dried sprig of clover. “If you wish to learn, begin by learning to see. Tomorrow, bring me three things overlooked by every other eye in the market. Not what shines, but what hides. In the finding, you will discover how to see the world as magic does.”

Bran swallowed hard, nodding. A riddle-task. A challenge. His first true step away from swords and shields, and onto a path far stranger, and far more dangerous.
