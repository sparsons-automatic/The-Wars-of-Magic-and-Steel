  Beneath the ancient roots of the Great Oak lies a hidden world where mice
  train with swords, magic has a will of its own, and courage can be found in
  the smallest of hearts. When young Bran discovers power stirring within him,
  he must decide whether to hide from destiny—or chase it into the depths of
  legend.
