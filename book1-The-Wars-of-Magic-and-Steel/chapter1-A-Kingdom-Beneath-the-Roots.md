## Chapter One: A Kingdom Beneath the Roots

The market caves hummed like a hive. Lantern-moss glowed soft green from the stone walls, lighting rows of woven baskets piled high with carrots, barley stalks, and glossy acorns. Mice bustled shoulder to shoulder, whiskers twitching as they haggled over turnip bundles or sniffed the ripest berries.

Brannoc pressed his paws against the wooden edge of his family’s stall, leaning forward on tiptoe. His sack of grain — carefully threshed and dried all week — had already been divided into neat scoops, tied in pouches of twine. He’d filled them himself. Today was supposed to be proof that he was growing up, able to work alongside his mother without being told three times what to do.

“Two pouches for one copper?” a field mouse in a patched cloak asked.

Bran straightened, voice squeaking louder than he wanted. “Three pouches for two copper, good grain — dry as autumn wind, I swear it!” His whiskers bristled nervously.

The customer chuckled, dropped the coin, and shuffled away with the grain. Bran let out a relieved squeak.

Above the chatter, the clanging of steel rang out from the practice grounds beyond the market wall. Every few breaths, cheers or groans rose from the trainees gathered there. Bran’s ears tilted instinctively toward the sound, his paws tightening on the edge of the stall.

“You’ll wear holes in those ears if you keep twitching like that,” his mother murmured, tail curling as she stacked more pouches. “The trials won’t wait for you. Go, before you burst.”

Bran blinked. “But— the stall—”

“I’ll mind it. What use is a son who can’t swing a blade? Go. Just don’t come back with a broken whisker.”

Bran’s heart leapt. He ducked under the woven awning, his small satchel bouncing against his side as he darted toward the sound of clashing steel. The path twisted upward, opening into the ring where the trainees gathered.

The Sword Trials.

Dozens of young mice stood in a circle, some hefting wooden practice blades, others watching with eager eyes. At the center, two figures clashed — older apprentices, their strikes sharp and heavy. Each blow rang against shields, sparks jumping as steel met steel. Bran’s paw went to the hilt at his belt. His practice sword, borrowed and far too heavy, thumped against his hip like a reminder: *You are too small.*

“Brannoc!” called Sir Alder, the knight overseeing the ring. His voice rumbled like stone. “Step forward. Let’s see if you can keep that sword in your paws this time.”

Snickers rippled through the circle. Bran’s cheeks burned, but he stepped forward into the sandy ring. The gate closed behind him with a click.

His opponent was Korrin — broad-shouldered, two seasons older, confident enough to smirk as he raised his practice blade. “Try not to trip, Bran,” he drawled.

Bran gripped his sword with both paws. It wobbled, heavy as a millstone. Sir Alder’s voice cut through the noise.

“Begin!”

Korrin lunged. Bran lifted his shield too slow — the blow slammed against it, rattling his teeth and nearly toppling him. The circle of mice laughed. Bran scrambled back, swinging his sword in a clumsy arc. Korrin batted it aside with ease.

Strike. Block. Stumble. Sand kicked into Bran’s eyes. His arms burned. His sword slipped lower with every swing.

“You’ll never last in war!” Korrin jeered, raising his blade for a final strike.

Bran’s paws slipped. The sword tumbled from his grasp, clattering to the sand. He gasped, shielding himself with bare paws as Korrin’s blade arced down—

—and then the wind answered.

A sudden gust whirled through the ring, tearing sand into the air. It struck Korrin like a shove, knocking him backward onto his tail. Gasps rippled through the crowd as Bran blinked in shock, whiskers whipping in the sudden breeze.

The gust faded as quickly as it had come, leaving the ring hushed.

Bran’s paws still tingled. His heart hammered. He didn’t know what he’d done — only that something inside him had leapt free, faster than thought, sharper than any sword.

Sir Alder’s eyes narrowed. “Brannoc…” His voice was low, unreadable. “Where did you learn *that*?”

Bran’s mouth opened, but no words came. Around him, the other mice stared — some with awe, others with fear.

And Bran realized with a sinking heart: whatever had just happened, it was not part of the trials.
