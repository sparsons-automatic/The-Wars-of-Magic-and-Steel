## Chapter Three: The First Lesson

The tunnels were hushed, the market’s chatter long faded into sleep. Bran’s paws carried him back through the roots, heart hammering as he retraced the path toward the Dustkeeper’s chamber. He told himself he wouldn’t be missed, that his mother’s knitting and his siblings’ snores would cover his absence. Still, each drip of water from the ceiling made his ears twitch.

The chamber glowed as before: candlelight soft against stone roots, dust motes dancing like tiny stars. Thistledown hunched at his desk, scratching something into a leather-bound tome. Without looking up, the old weasel said, “You came back.”

Bran swallowed. “You said… you’d teach me.”

Thistledown finally turned, his cloudy eyes gleaming. He swept the books aside, leaving only a square of parchment on the stone. “Then begin here.”

Bran tilted his head. “With paper?”

“The sword teaches strength of arm,” Thistledown murmured. “Magic teaches strength of mind. To move this, you must first still yourself.”

Bran sat, tail wrapped tight around his legs. He stared at the parchment. It stared back, stubbornly still.

He tried narrowing his eyes, clenching his paws, willing it to shift. Nothing. His whiskers quivered with frustration.

“Not force,” Thistledown said gently. “Attention. Like listening for the faintest squeak in the dark.”

Bran closed his eyes. He let his paws rest, his breathing slow. He thought of the whispering wind in the trial ring, of the silence that followed. A tingling spread through his whiskers.

The parchment twitched.

Bran gasped, eyes flying open. The scrap stilled again.

Thistledown chuckled. “And now you know the trick of it. When you grasp too tightly, it slips away. Try again.”

Bran nodded, determined. He steadied himself once more. A breeze rose, faint but real, sliding the paper across the desk. His heart leapt.

Then—rip. The scrap tore into fluttering pieces, scattering like autumn leaves. Bran winced. “I ruined it!”

“Ruined?” Thistledown’s whiskers twitched with amusement. “Or revealed another shape?”

Before Bran could answer, the scraps whirled together, folding sharply. They settled into the outline of a tiny mouse—crooked, but unmistakable. Bran’s mouth fell open.

A breath later, it collapsed back into dust.

Bran’s paws tingled. “I didn’t mean to do that.”

“Magic often plays before it obeys,” Thistledown said. “Focus is the difference between accident and art. You will learn.”

Bran sat in silence, chest warm with awe and fear all tangled together. He wanted to ask a hundred questions, but Thistledown simply closed the tome and blew out the candle.

“Enough for tonight,” the Dustkeeper said softly. “Your mind needs rest as much as your paws. Magic grows best in stillness.”

Bran hesitated. “So… I did it? A little?”

Thistledown smiled, a slow, tired curve of his whiskers. “You listened. That is more than most ever learn.”

When Bran stepped back into the tunnels, the air felt alive. The drip of water, the sway of roots—all seemed to breathe with him. He walked home carefully, the image of the folded paper-mouse glowing behind his eyes.

At home, he slipped into bed unnoticed. The burrow was quiet save for the low hum of sleeping breaths. Bran stared into the dark, paws tingling with leftover energy. He whispered to himself, “Tomorrow, I’ll do it again.”

Only then did sleep find him, gentle and full of shapes that swirled like dust and wind.

Morning came gently, with the whisper of roots shifting above and the scent of warm grain drifting through the burrow. Bran blinked awake to the dim green light of lantern-moss. For the first time in many nights, his body didn’t ache, and his thoughts felt clear—like the still air before dawn.

His siblings were still bundled in their straw nests, twitching in dreams. Bran slipped quietly from his blanket and stretched, tail curling with a small sigh of contentment. The memory of the parchment mouse flickered behind his eyes. *I really did it,* he thought, heart fluttering. *I made the wind listen.*

By the time he reached the market tunnels, his mother was already setting up their stall. Steam from nearby cookfires curled in lazy spirals, glinting in the soft mosslight. Bran fell into rhythm beside her—lifting sacks, stacking pouches, brushing stray kernels from the counter. The work felt easier than ever. His paws moved with quiet certainty, as though the air itself lent him strength.

He noticed things he hadn’t before: the way dust danced when a cart rolled by, the tiny currents of air that tugged at the stall’s awning, even the faint pulse of warmth where the hearth tunnels met the market wall. It all moved together—patterns within patterns, like a song only he could hear.

His mother’s voice broke the spell. “We’ll need more barley for the evening trade,” she said, tying a pouch with brisk paws. “Oh, and don’t forget to check our copper count. I swear half the customers ‘forget’ to pay full weight these days.”

Bran grinned and nodded, pretending to count coins though his mind was still wandering. His mother chatted on—about Mrs. Thimble’s new mushroom pies, about Sir Alder scolding the guards again, about how the river tunnels might flood come spring. Her voice was a familiar melody, grounding him back in the world of ordinary things.

Yet beneath it all, Bran felt a quiet hum in his chest, as if the market itself breathed with him. Somewhere deep in the tunnels, the wind stirred—soft and curious, waiting for him to listen again.

As the day brightened, the market swelled with chatter and movement. Bran found himself grinning at the bustle, the ordinary rhythm of life echoing through the caverns. He scooped grain from a burlap sack, the kernels slipping through his paws like tiny pebbles. When he reached for a new pouch, a stray breeze curled around him—a playful swirl that tugged at his fur.

He blinked and looked around. No one else seemed to notice. His mother was busy weighing acorns for a customer, her paws moving in practiced motions.

Bran hesitated, heart quickening. *Just a little,* he thought. *Like Thistledown said. Attention, not force.*

He took a breath, focusing on the grain scattered across the counter. The air seemed to respond, gathering itself. A few kernels lifted, tumbling together as if caught in an unseen current. They drifted neatly into the open pouch. Bran’s mouth fell open.

The wind stilled as quickly as it had come. He blinked at the filled bag, ears hot with disbelief and pride. His mother turned just in time to see the last few kernels settle.

Her paws froze mid-motion. For a moment, the noise of the market faded. Bran felt her eyes on him—not angry, not frightened, but startled in a way that made his stomach twist.

Then she smiled tightly. “You’re quick today,” she said, voice light. “Go fetch some water before the afternoon rush.”

Bran nodded too fast. “Right away!” He snatched up the jug and hurried from the stall, heart hammering. As he slipped into the side tunnel leading toward the stream, the cool air rushed against his fur. He wasn’t sure if it was his imagination, but he thought the breeze laughed softly as it followed him.
