## Chapter Three: The First Lesson

The tunnels were hushed, the market’s chatter long faded into sleep. Bran’s paws carried him back through the roots, heart hammering as he retraced the path toward the Dustkeeper’s chamber. He told himself he wouldn’t be missed, that his mother’s knitting and his siblings’ snores would cover his absence. Still, each drip of water from the ceiling made his ears twitch.

The chamber glowed as before: candlelight soft against stone roots, dust motes dancing like tiny stars. Thistledown hunched at his desk, scratching something into a leather-bound tome. Without looking up, the old weasel said, “You came back.”

Bran swallowed. “You said… you’d teach me.”

Thistledown finally turned, his cloudy eyes gleaming. He swept the books aside, leaving only a square of parchment on the stone. “Then begin here.”

Bran tilted his head. “With paper?”

“The sword teaches strength of arm,” Thistledown murmured. “Magic teaches strength of mind. To move this, you must first still yourself.”

Bran sat, tail wrapped tight around his legs. He stared at the parchment. It stared back, stubbornly still.

He tried narrowing his eyes, clenching his paws, willing it to shift. Nothing. His whiskers quivered with frustration.

“Not force,” Thistledown said gently. “Attention. Like listening for the faintest squeak in the dark.”

Bran closed his eyes. He let his paws rest, his breathing slow. He thought of the whispering wind in the trial ring, of the silence that followed. A tingling spread through his whiskers.

The parchment twitched.

Bran gasped, eyes flying open. The scrap stilled again.

Thistledown chuckled. “And now you know the trick of it. When you grasp too tightly, it slips away. Try again.”

Bran nodded, determined. He steadied himself once more. A breeze rose, faint but real, sliding the paper across the desk. His heart leapt.

Then—rip. The scrap tore into fluttering pieces, scattering like autumn leaves. Bran winced. “I ruined it!”

“Ruined?” Thistledown’s whiskers twitched with amusement. “Or revealed another shape?”

Before Bran could answer, the scraps whirled together, folding sharply. They settled into the outline of a tiny mouse—crooked, but unmistakable. Bran’s mouth fell open.

A breath later, it collapsed back into dust.

Bran’s paws tingled. “I didn’t mean to do that.”

“Magic often plays before it obeys,” Thistledown said. “Focus is the difference between accident and art. You will learn.”

Bran sat in silence, chest warm with awe and fear all tangled together. He wanted to ask a hundred questions, but Thistledown simply closed the tome and blew out the candle.

“Enough for tonight,” the Dustkeeper said softly. “Your mind needs rest as much as your paws. Magic grows best in stillness.”

Bran hesitated. “So… I did it? A little?”

Thistledown smiled, a slow, tired curve of his whiskers. “You listened. That is more than most ever learn.”

When Bran stepped back into the tunnels, the air felt alive. The drip of water, the sway of roots—all seemed to breathe with him. He walked home carefully, the image of the folded paper-mouse glowing behind his eyes.

At home, he slipped into bed unnoticed. The burrow was quiet save for the low hum of sleeping breaths. Bran stared into the dark, paws tingling with leftover energy. He whispered to himself, “Tomorrow, I’ll do it again.”

Only then did sleep find him, gentle and full of shapes that swirled like dust and wind.
